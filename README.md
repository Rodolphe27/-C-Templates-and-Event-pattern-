# Fuhrpark Management System

## Overview
This C# program serves as a learning project for understanding the implementation of the event pattern and the usage of templates in C#. The system demonstrates a basic Fleet Management System using the `Autos` namespace. It maintains a fleet of vehicles, allowing users to add vehicles, calculate the average age of the fleet, and display inventory information.

## Learning Objectives
- Implementation of the event pattern for handling events in C#.
- Usage of templates in C# to create a flexible and reusable fleet management system.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have a C# compiler installed to run the program.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FuhrparkManagement.git
   cd FuhrparkManagement
   csc Program.cs Autos.cs
   Program.exe
